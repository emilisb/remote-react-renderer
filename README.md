# Generating remote-ui-compatible workers

This work is based on [Shopify/remote-ui](https://github.com/Shopify/remote-ui/tree/main/examples/create-react-app) example:

    # Create React App + remote-ui
    This repo demonstrates how to incorporate a few different `@remote-ui` libraries into an app bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This library bundles two types of workers, compatible with rmeote-ui APIs for running react components on web workers.
- sandbox: where each component is rendered.
- foo/bar/example: three different vanilla react components.
